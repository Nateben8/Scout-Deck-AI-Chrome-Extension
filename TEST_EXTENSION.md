2. Click the ScoutDeck AI extension icon
3. The panel should inject into the page
4. If not signed in, you'll see an auth gate
5. Click "Sign in" to authenticate

### 3. Test the Complete Flow

1. **Sign in via popup**: Click extension icon ‚Üí Sign in with Google
2. **Verify authentication**: Popup should show your email and "Open Dashboard" button
3. **Test dashboard**: Click "Open Dashboard" - should open your website dashboard
4. **Test on Hudl**: Go to a Hudl page, the panel should work without asking for auth again
5. **Test sign out**: Click "Sign Out" in popup, should clear authentication

### 4. Expected Behavior

‚úÖ **Working correctly:**
- Extension popup shows sign-in UI when not authenticated
- Google OAuth redirects to your website and back to extension
- After sign-in, popup shows user email and dashboard button
- Panel on Hudl pages works without additional authentication
- "Open Dashboard" button opens your website
- Sign out clears authentication everywhere

‚ùå **Issues to check:**
- If popup doesn't show: Check if `popup.html` is set in manifest
- If sign-in fails: Check browser console for errors
- If redirect fails: Verify Google OAuth redirect URIs include extension URL
- If panel doesn't work: Check Hudl page console for errors

### 5. Debugging

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click "Details" on ScoutDeck AI extension
3. Click "Inspect views: background page"
4. Check console for errors

1. Right-click extension icon ‚Üí "Inspect popup"
2. Check console for errors

**Check Panel Console:**
